      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This homework deepens the analysis from the previous experiment — the Bernoulli process
        simulation of the Law of Large Numbers — and investigates its mathematical relationships
        with binomial coefficients, Pascal’s triangle, the binomial expansion, and other combinatorial
        structures. Through these connections, the statistical behavior of random cybersecurity events
        can be interpreted as part of a broader combinatorial and probabilistic framework.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>I. Analogy with the Previous Homework</h2>
      <p>
        In the earlier homework, each trajectory represented a server’s random walk through \( n \) weeks,
        with each step modeled as a Bernoulli variable:
        \[
        X_i = 
        \begin{cases}
          +1, & \text{if secure (probability } 1 - p) \\
          -1, & \text{if breached (probability } p)
        \end{cases}
        \]
        The total score after \( n \) steps, \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i = 2K - n \),
        directly depended on the number \( K \) of successful defenses, following
        a binomial distribution \( K \sim Bin(n, 1 - p) \).
      </p>

      <p>
        In both homeworks, the Bernoulli process lies at the core:
        independent trials, binary outcomes, and statistical convergence.
        In Homework 7, the focus was on the <em>empirical convergence</em> of random
        walks to a theoretical binomial law; in this homework, the focus shifts to
        the <em>mathematical and structural</em> properties underlying that same process.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>II. The Binomial Framework</h2>
      <p>
        The binomial distribution arises from the repeated application of the Bernoulli process.
        Its probability mass function is given by:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">
        \[
        P(K = k) = \binom{n}{k} (1 - p)^k p^{n - k}
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        The coefficients \( \binom{n}{k} \) not only count combinations but also form the
        entries of <strong>Pascal’s triangle</strong>, which encodes the recursive identity:
        \[
        \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}
        \]
        This mirrors the recursive, step-by-step nature of both the Bernoulli process
        and the random walk simulation, where each new observation builds on the previous one.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>III. Binomial Expansion and Probabilistic Symmetry</h2>
      <p>
        The binomial theorem expands any power of a sum:
        \[
        (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^k b^{n-k}.
        \]
        When \( a = (1 - p) \) and \( b = p \), the entire distribution of possible outcomes
        for \( n \) trials appears within a single algebraic expression — a compact symbolic
        version of what the simulation in Homework 7 computed numerically.
      </p>
      <p>
        As \( n \) grows, the distribution becomes increasingly symmetric around
        its mean \( E[K] = n(1 - p) \), a reflection of the Law of Large Numbers.
        This symmetry in the coefficients of the expansion corresponds to the shape
        of the random walk histogram observed previously.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IV. Fibonacci, Combinatorics, and Recursive Growth</h2>
      <p>
        The recursive structure of Pascal’s triangle also appears in the
        <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong>. When summed along its shallow diagonals,
        Pascal’s triangle generates Fibonacci numbers:
        \[
        F_n = \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{n-1-k}{k}.
        \]
        This recurrence mirrors the probabilistic evolution of the Bernoulli process,
        where each new step depends on combinations of earlier possibilities.
        Such structural overlap illustrates how combinatorial mathematics and probability
        share the same recursive DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
        In cybersecurity terms, this can be viewed as the recursive propagation of
        defense success probabilities through time — each new defense builds on
        multiple potential past states, exactly like Fibonacci recursion aggregates
        past outcomes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>V. Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Both Homework 7 and Homework 8 revolve around the same Bernoulli foundation.
        Homework 7 visualized randomness through simulation and convergence;
        Homework 8 formalizes that behavior through combinatorial and algebraic structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The connection between the binomial coefficients, Pascal’s triangle,
        the binomial theorem, and even Fibonacci recursion reveals a unifying principle:
        discrete probability and combinatorics describe the same underlying symmetry.
        Whether modeled as a cybersecurity random walk or expressed as an algebraic expansion,
        the mathematics of repetition, accumulation, and convergence remains the same.
